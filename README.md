# Reusable React Button Component
The button accepts a `prop` (called: `variant`) that changes the button's color with the following options:

- `primary` (**default**) (CSS variable: `--primary-color`)
- `accent` (CSS variable: `--accent-color`)
- `success` (CSS variable: `--success-color`)
- `danger` (CSS variable: `--danger-color`)

The button is also able to take in other props such as size as well as other vanilla CSS or Tailwind CSS classes.
